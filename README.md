# remoteops geomanager
 A simple leaflet Map generated from QGIS using qgis2web plugin. I have included the leaflet-sidebar and appended the filters on to the sidebar and transformed them into a multiselect dropdown list. I have used geoman to draw polygons and select markers within the polygons and display their properties on the sidebar onclick.
